The aim 01: Initialize a Vue 3 project with TypeScript and connect it to a GitHub repository. 
Actual prompt: "order of commands to upload my local code to github"

The aim 02: Understanding TypeScript Interfaces and Vue Core concepts (ref, onMounted).
Actual prompt: "How do I define a TypeScript interface for the User API from DummyJSON? Specifically, 
how do I define a list of users within that interface without using 'any'? 
Also, can you explain the meaning of 'ref' and 'onMounted' in Vue 3, and 
how this type-definition logic compares to languages like C# or C?" 

The aim 03: To understand the implementation of asynchronous data fetching using the Fetch API and managing 
component state in Vue 3 with TypeScript. 
Actual prompt: "Can you explain how the asynchronous function to fetch data from an API works step-by-step? 
Specifically, explain the use of async/await, try-catch blocks, and how the fetched data is assigned to a 
reactive variable while maintaining type safety."

The aim 04: To design and implement a modular component architecture for the SPA, ensuring separation of concerns 
and reusability as per the technical requirements.
Actual prompt: "Explain the concept of Component Architecture in Vue 3. How should I break down my application into reusable components 
like NavBar, UserList, and UserCard? Also, explain the parent-child relationship in terms of data flow."

The aim 05: To implement a fully responsive grid layout using Tailwind CSS utility classes, ensuring compatibility 
across mobile, tablet, and desktop view ports as per project requirements.
Actual prompt: "Explain how to create a responsive grid layout in Tailwind CSS that shows 1 column on mobile, 
2 on tablets, and 4 on desktops. Provide the specific class names and their meanings."

The aim 06: To implement real-time search functionality using two-way data binding (v-model) and reactive 
filtering with Computed Properties, ensuring the UI updates dynamically based on user input.
Actual prompt: "explain about computed and v-model searchQuery. How can I use them together to filter a list 
of users fetched from an API in Vue 3?"

The aim 07: To establish communication from child to parent components using custom events (Emits), enabling 
user interaction such as opening a detail modal for a specific item as required by the project specifications.
Actual prompt: "Explain the usage of defineEmits and event listeners like @view-details in Vue 3. 
How can I use them to trigger a function in a parent component when a button is clicked in a child component?"
